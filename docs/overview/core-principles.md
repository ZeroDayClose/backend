# Core Principles

These five principles guide every product decision at ZeroDayClose.

---

## 1. Accuracy Over Speed

Never sacrifice correctness for automation. Every automated action is validated against strict accounting constraints before execution.

---

## 2. Explainability First

Every AI decision must have traceable reasoning. Users can always drill down from an aggregated number to the specific source transactions or documents that generated it.

**Implementation:**
- AI confidence scores displayed for every suggestion
- Reasoning visible in the interface
- Graph traversal paths exposed
- Complete audit trails for everything

---

## 3. Learn from Corrections

Human feedback improves the system. When users correct an AI suggestion, the system:
- Updates the knowledge graph
- Adjusts confidence scoring
- Improves future pattern matching

This creates a virtuous cycle of continuous improvement.

## 4. Mobile-Native

Finance doesn't stop at 5pm or when you leave your desk. The platform is designed for:
- Approvals on-the-go
- Real-time notifications
- Responsive interfaces

---

## 5. Self-Hosted Option

Banks and regulated industries need on-premise deployment. ZeroDayClose supports:
- Cloud deployment (default)
- Self-hosted/on-premise installation
- Hybrid configurations

---

## Trust Through Transparency

These principles all tie back to a central theme: **Trust through transparency**.
