## Architecture Principles

### 1. API-First Design

All functionality is exposed via REST APIs:
- OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation
- Consistent response formats
- Versioned endpoints

### 2. Event-Driven Processing

Asynchronous processing for scalability:
- Task queues for background jobs
- Event sourcing for audit trails
- Real-time sync via webhooks

### 3. Microservices-Ready

Modular architecture supporting:
- Independent scaling of components
- Container-based deployment
- Service mesh integration
