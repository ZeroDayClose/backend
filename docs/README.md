# ZeroDayClose

> **AI-native Finance Operation System with Audit-Ready Automation**

**ZeroDayClose** is an AI-powered accounting reconciliation platform that enables mid-market companies to close their books in **1 day instead of 10 days** through intelligent automation powered by context graph technology.

Unlike traditional accounting software that relies on rigid rules or basic pattern matching, ZeroDayClose builds a **living knowledge graph** that learns each firm's unique accounting DNA — capturing vendor relationships, approval patterns, seasonal trends, and policy exceptions.
